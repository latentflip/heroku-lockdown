= Heroku-Lockdown
Heroku-Lockdown is a plugin for the heroku gem for people using heroku in production. If you are running more than one heroku server for the same app (maybe myapp-production, and myapp-staging), you might be worried about typing;

    heroku db:reset --myapp-production

when you meant

    heroku db:reset --myapp-staging

which would be a disaster. This plugin should help prevent that with a simple config file, ~/.herokurc

== Installation
* Assuming you have the heroku gem installed:

    heroku plugins:install git://github.com/latentflip/heroku-lockdown.git

* _Only tested so far on heroku setups where you have to add --app to commands. (i.e. more than one heroku app for a single git repo)

== Usage
* Create/edit ~/.herokurc
* Add a line for each command and app pair you want to prevent, like so:

    #This will prevent db:reset being run on --app myapp-production
    protect myapp-production db:reset
